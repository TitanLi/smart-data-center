Arduino Energy Monitoring Library - compatible with Arduino 1.0
*****************************************************************

Designed for use with emonTx: http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/Modules

Download to Arduino IDE 'libraries' folder. Restart of IDE required.

Git Clone and Git Pull can be easily used to keep the library up-to-date and manage changes.
JeeLabs has done a good post on the topic: http://jeelabs.org/2011/12/29/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/



Update: 5th January 2014: Support Added for Arduino Due (ARM Cortex-M3, 12-bit ADC) by icboredman.

To enable this feature on Arduino Due, add the following statement to setup() function in main sketch:
analogReadResolution(ADC_BITS); This will set ADC_BITS to 12 (Arduino Due), EmonLib will otherwise default to 10 analogReadResolution(ADC_BITS);.
